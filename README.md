Starter template for AngularJS apps.  Built using the [Yeoman Angular Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular).  Added [320+](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/) for the responsive-ness.  Breakpoints at 480, 600, 768, 992 and 1382.  Uses the [Skeleton CSS Grid](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/).

To get started

MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.
## Overview

One of the most frequently asked features from MEAN users is a way to scaffold their applications. As we looked for a way to help the community build and deploy production level MEAN applications, we decided to go with a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/index.html) generator. Yeoman generators provides a powerful, easy to maintain, and open solution for scaffolding applications.



So, we set out to work on the features we thought every developer needs, and we are proud to present the official MEAN.JS Yeoman generator. It includes a set of simple tools you can use to make your MEAN application development easier and way more fun.



## Getting Started

Before you begin make sure you have the [yo scaffolding tool](http://yeoman.io/generators/) installed(As it is part of the Yeoman tool set you might have installed it before). To globally install *yo* you will need to use npm:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Once you have *yo* installed, you will need to install the Angular generator

```
$ npm install -g generator-angular
```

You are now ready to get started with the MEAN.JS generator. The generator will help you create a MEAN.JS application, a CRUD module, Angular Module, and other AngularJS/Express entities.

## Generators

[Available generators](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#generators) 

**Note: Generators are to be run from the root directory of your app.**

## Testing

BP Tests are setup in the /spec directory
