Starter template for AngularJS apps.  Built using the [Yeoman Angular Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular).  Added [320+](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/) for the responsive-ness.  Breakpoints at 480, 600, 768, 992 and 1382.  Uses the [Skeleton CSS Grid](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/).

## Getting Started

Before you begin make sure you have the [yo scaffolding tool](http://yeoman.io/generators/) installed(As it is part of the Yeoman tool set you might have installed it before). To globally install *yo* you will need to use npm:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Once you have *yo* installed, you will need to install the Angular generator

```
$ npm install -g generator-angular
```

You are now ready to get started with the MEAN.JS generator. The generator will help you create a MEAN.JS application, a CRUD module, Angular Module, and other AngularJS/Express entities.

## Generators

[Available generators](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#generators) 

**Note: Generators are to be run from the root directory of your app.**

## Testing

BP Tests are setup in the /spec directory
